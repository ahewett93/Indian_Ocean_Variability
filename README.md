# Indian_Ocean_Variability
<h1>My Analysis of 30 years of ocean and atmosphere data from the Indian Ocean region</h1>
<p>I performed this analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPY, Xarray, Matplotlib) while working as a Lapenta intern with NOAA</p>
<p>I apologize as I cannot upload the Jupyter Notebook used for analysis due to excessive file size. Please enjoy the presentations! The PowerPoint version contains animations.</p>
